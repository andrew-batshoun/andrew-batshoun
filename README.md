# Hi I'm Andrew

Software Developer and Army veteran with experience in leading and training and a heart for engaging in the community through volunteer work. My time in the military helped to hone my skills in troubleshooting and problem-solving, which increased my resourcefulness and ability to find multiple ways to solve a problem. This is what I enjoy about coding and what has inspired the transition to a career in web development. Motivated and eager to join a collaborative environment and expand my current skill set through new challenges.
